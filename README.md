# SoundCloud_Stat_Tracker

SoundCloud Stat tracker was built as a way to track a song's popularity and growth using metrics from soundcloud. 

By using the SoundCloud API, python pickling, and csv writing, one can create a playlist on soundcloud
the use the program to capture favorite counts, and play counts. These metrics are then exported to a csv file to show
song growth percentange and other metrics in a presentable fashion.
